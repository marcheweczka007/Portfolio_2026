  bioP1:
    "I’m a product designer with experience working on SaaS products, comfortable wearing multiple hats as needed, from shaping design systems to creating things like e-books for marketing campaigns. I enjoy working where design extends beyond screens and supports the product as a whole. ",
  bioP2:
    "I work closely with developers and have been learning to code myself, which has become a natural extension of my design practice. I’m intentionally developing these skills further, using AI tools to prototype and test ideas quickly.",
  bioP3:
    "I’ve worked both independently and within cross-functional teams, and I’ve learned that the best work happens when everyone builds together. ",
