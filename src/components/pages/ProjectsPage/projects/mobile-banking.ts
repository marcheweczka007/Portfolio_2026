  overview:
    "The project began with alignment sessions between our client, Grand Bank, and our VP of Design. As designers, we joined the process once the problem was defined and the client's needs were outlined to us. From there, we created mobile-first wireframes and iterated based on feedback, going through several rounds of refinement over a few weeks until the client was confident in the feature we designed and delivered.",
  challenge:
    "Due to time constraints, the client requested high-fidelity wireframes early on, wanting to see the product vision in a near-final state. Personally, I prefer to start with low-fidelity sketches to ensure no key elements or actions are missed, which helps reduce rework later. However, in this case we delivered high-fidelity screens quickly, as required by our manager. As we iterated, I noticed that some communication misalignments could have been avoided if we had invested more time in low-fidelity exploration first. In total, the client requested three to four rounds of changes.",
