    "I care deeply about how the end product feels and works, which is why I want to design closer to implementation. This helps me collaborate more closely with front-end engineers, reduce friction, and make design decisions that work in practice — not just in theory. This approach feels especially important in fast-moving SaaS teams.",

  projectsDescription:
    "I’ve worked in SaaS start-ups on projects of all sizes, from small improvements to more complex product work. I enjoy making interfaces feel clean, intuitive, and genuinely nice to use, with attention to both usability and detail. Working within real constraints is what I enjoy most, it pushes me to think more creatively, and that’s usually when the best ideas start to emerge.",
