    "*I'm still early in my design engineering journey, but I'm learning a lot and I'm excited to share my processes with you. Building my portfolio in code has helped me stay closer to how products are actually made. It’s pushed me to think more in components, constraints, and real implementation. This way of working feels like the right direction for me as a product designer.",
